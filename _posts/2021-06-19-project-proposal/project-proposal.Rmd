# VAST Challenge 2021
As part of our module ISSS608 - Visual Analytics and Applications and VAST Challenge 2021, our team would be embarking on a project based on the context provided within VAST Challenge 2021.

# Context
In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem. - *extracted from VAST Challenge 2021 website [here](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/)*

# Motivation of the Project
We are the Visual Analytics Project Team that are called in to help the law enforcement from Kronos and Tethys. In broad, we would be attempting to merge/ link the insights discovered in Mini-Challenge 1 and Mini-Challenge 2. We would attempt to:

* Establish linkages between organisations, people, places and events.
* Identify possible official/non-official relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA and Government.
* Pick up any anomalies with regard to people, activities and locations.
* Establish possible linkages between the insights discovered

# Our Approach
The following are the broad approaches that we would be exploring:

* Transactions and Location Analysis and Visualization: Gain insights based on possible linkage between credit card and loyalty card transactions. In addition, with the GPS data, discover insights or linkages among them. We envisage development of a geographical trajectory of car movement with time for visualization.
* Social Network Analysis and Visualization: Gain insights between the relationships among the people from their activities and communication. A social network would then be drawn up.
* Movement Analysis: With the location of the transactions, and the GPS data, to gain insights on the movement of individuals or groups.
* New Analysis: To establish a timeline of a series of events, analysing trending articles from primary/ derivative sources.
* Facilitate story telling and aid in investigation via interesting and interactive Visuals

# The Tasks
**Mini-Challenge 1**

* Establish possible relationships between personnel. (Sources: resumes, email correspondences) 

  + Resumes (go through employment history)
  + Email Correspondences (group titles, categorize personal and official notes etc.)
  + Identify any possible links with data from Mini-Challenge 2

* Apply centrality and text mining concepts for correspondences

**Mini-Challenge 2**

* Trace the geolocation data of each personnel via the car assigned 

* Identify suspicious meet-ups between cars, meet-ups at odd timings

* Analyse credit card and loyalty card transactions

  + Integrate credit card and loyalty card transaction data
  + Identify notable purchase patterns, establish frequency of visits at specific outlets
  + Trace the person who is making the purchase via location and timing incidences of cars
  + Identify any possible links with data from Mini-Challenge 1

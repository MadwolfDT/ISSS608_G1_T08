  A fictitious scenario was created as part of VAST Challenge 2021. A group of staff members from GASTech, an oil and gas company situated on an island known as Abila on Kronos, had gone missing mysteriously. A group known as Protectors of Kronos (POK) was the prime suspect into the disappearance. A series of unprocessed data were made available to the law enforcement agencies to investigate on. The data were split across three mini challenges, which our team had undertaken Mini Challenge 1 and 2.

  Mini Challenge 1 consists of email correspondences, employee records and resumes, historical documents and news articles. The ojective of this mini challenge is to identify the complex relationships among the people and organisations, and possibly infer the disappearance of GASTech to any individuals/group who might be involved.  Mini Challenge 2 consists of gps tracking, transaction and loyalty card records, together with car assignment records - linked to the gps tracking data. The objective of this mini challenge is to discover anomalies and suspicious activites that may require additional investigating.
  
  The objective of this research paper is to share on the methods and models used to develop an online investigative tool where a law enforcement at Kronos and Tethys could use, to piece the raw data into useable information and evidences.

# Introduction

A fictitious scenario was created as part of VAST Challenge 2021. A group of staff members from GASTech, an oil and gas company situated on an island known as Abila on Kronos, had gone missing mysteriously. A group known as Protectors of Kronos (POK) was the prime suspect into the disappearance. While Mini Challenge 1 and 2 provided a set of raw data that allow investigators to establish and identify complex relationships among the people and organisations, discover anomalies and suspicious activities, such investigative work may require humongous man hours and effort, without data analytics and visualisation. 

We would be using Shiny R to develop an online investigative tool to aid in the analysis into the disappearance of GASTech Personnel, allowing investigators to explore information and inferential statistics derived from the unprocessed data available.

# Motivation

The motivation of this project would be two-fold. First, the data presented to the investigators were raw and unprocessed, and to link and derive insights from these data would require tremendous man hours and effort. Second, while insights could be derived and useful information could be formed, there would be a need to present the information in a visually appealing format to facilitate information dissemination and to allow quick collective appreciation of events among the investigators.

To this end, we would be looking to develop a R Shiny app based on three principles: (a) informative; (b) intuitive and; (c) interactive. Our 3Is principles would have the data undergoing baseline cleaning, making them into suitable formats for subsequent processing for information delivery. The user-interface would be made intuitive so that the investigator would be able to use the application without much references to our user guide. The online investigative tool would also be interactive, such that the investigator would be able to provide varied inputs into the formation towards the final visualisation report.

The R Shiny app would comprise of two main modules: (a) Exploratory Data Analysis allowing investigators to draw information such as transaction records, employee records, email correspondences and such; (b) Inferential Statistics allowing investigators to infer relationship linkages among user-selected employees, possible coded words within email correspondences within an identified group of personnel, their movements towards identified locations and possible anomalies at the locations and transaction analysis using both credit card and loyalty card data.

# Review and Critic of Past Works

Taking reference on a submission by students from International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, they had derived an interface that uses geotools to show the paths of the cars, moving at a particular time or date.  While it was a useful tool to visualise the movement of the vehicles, it was unable to plot the locations where the vehicles may had visited. This would be addressed in one of our module.

While credit card data and loyalty card data were provided for, to the investigators, there are no direct linkages between both set of data, except for the locations and price of item. The timestamp for both data are recorded differently with the credit card indicating the time of transaction while loyalty data indicating date of transactions only. Reviewing past work from members of University of Calgary, they attempted Parallel Coordinates plot by linking the locations, timestamp, price and employees, to establish possible linkages among the four variables. Inspired by their work and the sharing from Prof Kam on using Parallel Coordinates Plot on R, we would attempt to create parallel plots and allow the investigators to decide the variables that they are keen to establish linkages with.

# Design Frame

Our R Shiny Investigative Tool's design would be based on our 3Is principle.

*Informative* - A series of informative modules would be made available under the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tab, comprising of: (a) Locations Exploration; (b) Transactions Exploration; (c) Cards Exploration; (d) GASTech Employees Information; and (e) Email Correspondences. Details of each modules would be covered under the sub-sections later.

*Intuitive* - The entire UI design would be simple and intuitive, allowing investigators to use it without frequent references to our user guide. This would be done by ensuring that appropriate input methods were used and that the UI would be kept as clean and simple as possible.

*Interactive* - The respective modules would require specific inputs from the investigators before a representative visualisation could be produced. It would be made interactive such that the investigators would have the flexibility to select various variables or inputs to create the desired visualisation. Similarly, the investigators would have the option to save the produced visualisation separately.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Locations - For Exploration!

![](img/Locations.PNG)


The intention of this module would be to allow the investigators to explore the popularity of the locations through the analysis of transaction records. It would be conducted in a manner by aggregating the transaction records based on the time of transactions. The transaction counts would be plotted against the aggregated time of transactions and locations using a heatmap to infer the peak periods for the locations. The selected records would be filtered based on the range of date inputs, time range of transactions, with the ability to toggle between weekdays, weekends or both.


![](img/Locations2.PNG)

The function of this module would be to identify the operating days of the locations through the analysis of credit card transactions, through the aggregation of records based on the day of transactions. The output of this visualisation would suggest the days where the locations would be having transactions, thus inferring their operating days of the week.

## Transactions - For Exploration!

The intention of this module would be to allow investigators to explore all credit card and loyalty card transactional records at each location. The type of visualization chosen enables the investigators to see the linkages between all variables in one view. 

![](img/P01Para.jpg)

The plot has multiple functions which would allow the investigator to customize his/her view and get more insights, such as (1) Variables to be included can be selected, (2) Variables can be reordered, (3) Range of Credit Card Numbers to display records for can be selected, (4) Specific ranges of each variable can be selected so that only associated links would be shown, (5) Selected ranges can be glided along the axis to see how the connections change dynamically. These customizations and flexibilities are important so that the user can zoom in and out on selected areas of focus, especially when exploring raw data sets. If a certain value, say for a specific credit card number, appears in multiple observations, its associations would be clearly displayed in the form of the series of lines.

## Employee Movement Plot

![](img/Movement.PNG)

The data preparation for this module would be to identify Points-of-Interests (POI), using the gps records. Since the recording of gps would only occur while the vehicle is in motion, whenever there is a time interval (3g: 3 minutes), would be a good assumption that the vehicle is in parking mode, thus indicating it as a POI. The time interval may be adjusted based on the investigators' tolerance between 3 and 15 minutes. The POIs would be differentiated between homes of employees and other locations, thus allowing tmap to plot the route taken, and the stops taken.

![](img/Movement2.PNG)

The sub-module would be an extension where the selected gps plot would be sequenced based on the time of activity, and further identified based on marked locations such as their homes, GASTech or prominent locations that were named prior. The subsequent box plot would be an analysis of the duration of stop, by visitors, to the locations.

# Future Works

(Additional point from Nikki on how the modules could be improved.)

(Additional point from Rhoda on how the modules could be improved.)

An improvement towards the Employee Movement Plot could include further analysis on the movement route, in terms of the distance/ speed, which may suggest the vehicle were kept in idle mode, which is currently unable to detected under the current module. In addition, the streets of Abila could be identified based on the movement routes, and thus, and analysis could be conducted whether the vehicle was travelling in a suspicious manner.

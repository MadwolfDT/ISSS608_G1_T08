In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem. - extracted from VAST Challenge 2021 website here\r\nMotivation of the Project\r\nWe are the Visual Analytics Project Team that are called in to help the law enforcement from Kronos and Tethys. In broad, we would be attempting to merge/ link the insights discovered in Mini-Challenge 1 and Mini-Challenge 2. We would attempt to:\r\nEstablish linkages between organisations, people, places and events.\r\nIdentify possible official/non-official relationships among GASTech, POK, the APA and Government.\r\nPick up any anomalies with regard to people, activities and locations.\r\nEstablish possible linkages between the insights discovered\r\nOur Approach\r\nThe following are the broad approaches that we would be exploring:\r\nTransactions and Location Analysis and Visualization: Gain insights based on possible linkage between credit card and loyalty card transactions. In addition, with the GPS data, discover insights or linkages among them. We envisage development of a geographical trajectory of car movement with time for visualization.\r\nSocial Network Analysis and Visualization: Gain insights between the relationships among the people from their activities and communication. A social network would then be drawn up.\r\nMovement Analysis: With the location of the transactions, and the GPS data, to gain insights on the movement of individuals or groups.\r\nNew Analysis: To establish a timeline of a series of events, analysing trending articles from primary/ derivative sources.\r\nFacilitate story telling and aid in investigation via interesting and interactive Visuals\r\nThe Tasks\r\nMini-Challenge 1\r\nEstablish possible relationships between personnel. (Sources: resumes, email correspondences)\r\nResumes (go through employment history)\r\nEmail Correspondences (group titles, categorize personal and official notes etc.)\r\nIdentify any possible links with data from Mini-Challenge 2\r\n\r\nApply centrality and text mining concepts for correspondences\r\nMini-Challenge 2\r\nTrace the geolocation data of each personnel via the car assigned\r\nIdentify suspicious meet-ups between cars, meet-ups at odd timings\r\nAnalyse credit card and loyalty card transactions\r\nIntegrate credit card and loyalty card transaction data\r\nIdentify notable purchase patterns, establish frequency of visits at specific outlets\r\nTrace the person who is making the purchase via location and timing incidences of cars\r\nIdentify any possible links with data from Mini-Challenge 1\r\n\r\nR Shiny Plans\r\nTransactions Tab (Transactional data)\r\nSocial Network Tab (Mapping relationships, both personal and professional)\r\nPerson Location Tracking Tab (Map of the island, personâ€™s whereabout, path tracking)\r\nNews Tab\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.\r\nIn January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearances.\r\nMany of the Abila, Kronos-based employees of GAStech have company cars which are approved for both personal and business use. Those who do not have company cars have the ability to check out company trucks for business use, but these trucks cannot be used for personal business.\r\nEmployees with company cars are happy to have these vehicles, because the company cars are generally much higher quality than the cars they would be able to afford otherwise. However, GAStech does not trust their employees. Without the employees? knowledge, GAStech has installed geospatial tracking software in the company vehicles. The vehicles are tracked periodically as long as they are moving.\r\nThis vehicle tracking data has been made available to law enforcement to support their investigation. Unfortunately, data is not available for the day the GAStech employees went missing. Data is only available for the two weeks prior to the disappearance.\r\nTo promote local businesses, Kronos based companies provide a Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards. This data has been made available to investigators in the hopes that it can help resolve the situation. However, Kronos Kares does not collect personal information beyond purchases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
